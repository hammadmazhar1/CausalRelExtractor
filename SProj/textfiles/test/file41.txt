When Ready for Hillary, a pro-Hillary Rodham Clinton 'super PAC,' wanted to take out a million-dollar loan five months before it planned to go out of business, it turned to a bank that was founded to guard the savings of New York City garment workers.When the Democracy Alliance, an influential club of liberal donors, sought to recruit members in advance of the 2016 elections, the bank's president helped to make introductions.And when workers-rights groups wanted to embarrass Walmart and the Gap for unsafe working conditions at factories supplying their stores, Amalgamated Bank, which manages $40 billion in pension fund assets, stepped in again, rounding up fellow investors to warn the companies that they could face lawsuits and shareholder actions.Four years after nearly collapsing amid the financial crisis, Amalgamated has aggressively carved out a position as the left's private banker, leveraging deep connections with the Democratic establishment to expand rapidly in a niche long dominated by larger but less nimble financial institutions.The bank's rise has been driven not only by the pace and complexity of modern campaigns, which demand increasingly specialized financial services, but by their vastly expanded scale: Billion-dollar presidential campaigns are expected for both parties in 2016, bolstered by super PACs raising hundreds of millions of dollars more.And with Republican outside groups raising substantially more than their left-leaning counterparts this year, Democratic strategists viewed Amalgamated as a tool to leverage the financial clout of labor unions and left-leaning philanthropists.Founded and still principally owned by labor unions, the 92-year-old bank has signed up hundreds of new political clients, including most of the Democratic Party's major committees, the progressive organizations that align with them, and several of their top Senate recruits.This spring, Amalgamated scored its biggest coup yet, winning the main business for Mrs. Clinton's presidential campaign, which is likely to raise a billion dollars or more.Campaign clients have access to a 24-hour concierge service, staffed by veterans of President Obama's campaigns, to handle last-minute media buys or reconcile election paperwork.Because it knows their donor world, Amalgamated is willing to advance cash on new contributions, almost immediately. It works directly with 'caging' companies that process campaigns' direct-mail donations, making the money available in hours, rather than days or weeks. The bank's wire room stays open until just before 6 p.m., hours later than most commercial banks, to enable cash transfers to TV stations.That flexibility, Democrats said, helped allow their campaigns to more fully exploit the sophisticated targeting and data tools that have ramped up the tactical pace of election campaigns, in which the ability to execute hour-by-hour decisions is constrained only by cash flow.'Two hours make a big difference,' said Rebecca Pearcey, the campaign manager for Ted Strickland, an Ohio Democrat seeking election to the Senate in 2016. 'Especially if it is two weeks before the election, and you know that people in Akron are going to be watching 'Wheel of Fortune' on Thursday and you need to get in front of them.'In some instances, Amalgamated has served as a kind of lender of last resort for campaigns and super PACs, organizations with little or no credit history and erratic cash flow. Ready for Hillary, for example, was founded two years ago and intended to stay in business only until Mrs. Clinton got into the 2016 presidential race, building lists of small donors and grass-roots organizers that could later be made available to her campaign.In October, the group sought $1 million so it could accelerate those efforts before it closed down. Amalgamated, officials at the now-closed super PAC said, was willing to underwrite the loan against the flow of future contributions.Keith Mestrich, a former union official who became the bank's president last year, said in an interview that he could not discuss specific clients, but that finding creative ways to serve allies effectively was important to the bank's mission.'As our progressive partners have real issues they are grappling with, we can take the time and energy to come up with a fix to the problems they have,' Mr. Mestrich said.Candidates of both parties often keep at least some of their money in home-state banks, for appearance's sake.But many Republican candidates and super PACs, including Jeb Bush and the deep-pocketed super PAC supporting him, do the bulk of their banking with their own version of Amalgamated, the smaller Chain Bridge Bank, based in McLean, Va. Founded by Peter Fitzgerald, the former Republican senator from Illinois, Chain Bridge broke into political banking amid the 2008 financial crisis when the Republican presidential nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, was looking for a safe place to deposit his war chest. He chose it for its Republican pedigree and low-risk balance sheet.But unlike competitors, Amalgamated marries its political banking business to $40 billion in trust assets, mostly union pension funds, that it has used to help activist investors who share its ideological bent.Amalgamated has been a lead plaintiff in several of the largest derivative lawsuits in recent years, including a successful $150 million lawsuit against Duke Energy, one of the largest power companies in the country.The bank is now involved in an effort to lobby state lawmakers in Delaware, where about half of all publicly traded United States corporations are incorporated, to prevent businesses domiciled there from shifting the costs of shareholder lawsuits onto investors.Amalgamated also has deep ties to the liberal philanthropic and nonprofit worlds, including liberal foundations that finance abortion and gay rights causes, some of them clients.In recent months, it has begun branching into what amounts to political investment banking, helping progressive organizations recruit donors.Mr. Mestrich, the bank's president, now heads the recruitment committee for the Democracy Alliance, which funnels tens of millions of dollars annually into left-leaning political groups.Amalgamated is also helping another client, the League of Conservation Voters, organize a fund-raiser for pro-environment Senate candidates, scheduled for the fall.'They are starting to be a key partner in terms of protecting the environment on a wide range of strategies,' said Gene Karpinski, the president of the League of Conservation Voters. 'That includes major efforts such as joining in litigation and shareholder resolution activities.'But doing well by its ideological allies is also good business for Amalgamated, which was founded by the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America in 1923 to provide loans and savings accounts to garment workers. That union's successor, Workers United, remains the bank's majority owner.The longer the campaign season stretches, and the earlier candidates begin raising and spending money, the more money Amalgamated has on deposit and the more fees it collects.And while political banking is too small a market for the largest banks to bother specializing in, it is a significant area of growth for Amalgamated.The bank nearly collapsed in 2011 after it was forced to write off $150 million in subprime loans. An expanding commercial banking business, including an increase in political clients, has helped the bank bounce back.'Financial services goes through these cycles where at one point it is all the megacompanies, and since people get lost in the shuffle, you have these boutiques spring up and then they do well,' said Wilbur L. Ross, the billionaire New York investor, who invested $50 million in Amalgamated as part of a 2011 deal to replenish the bank's capital reserves. 'I think there's a real need for the kinds of things that Amalgamated is doing.'Mr. Mestrich, formerly the chief financial officer at the Service Employees International Union, joined the bank's Washington office in 2012 and put a special emphasis on expanding the bank's political business beyond unions.Seventy-one new clients have signed up in 2015 alone, according to Federal Election Commission filings, including the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the party's three main super PACs and the liberal opposition research group founded by David Brock, a Clinton ally.'We have to run an extremely well-run institution that properly assesses risk, that is willing to work with other organizations but not take chances that put the bank at risk,' Mr. Mestrich said. 'At the end of the day, we have to be a solid financial institution that is around for many years.'

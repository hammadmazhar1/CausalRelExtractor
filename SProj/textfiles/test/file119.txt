WASHINGTON -  When Joseph R. Biden Jr. became the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1987, a few months ahead of his first and ultimately unsuccessful presidential campaign, he told aides his goal was to enact legislation that would take a comprehensive approach to reducing crime.As the ranking minority member of the committee since 1981, Mr. Biden had helped pass two bills establishing mandatory minimums for drug offenses. But as chairman, facing high violent crime rates, a crack cocaine epidemic, and accusations by Republicans that his party was soft on crime, Mr. Biden wanted holistic reform.The effort, which defined much of his time as committee chairman, culminated in the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, a sweeping, bipartisan bill that touched nearly every aspect of American law enforcement that was signed into law by President Bill Clinton.More than two decades later, that legislation is once again the subject of fierce debate - this time, as a bipartisan coalition of activists and lawmakers seeks to undo the era of mass incarceration they say the 1994 crime bill helped create.The rapid shift in mood that those efforts reflect - a reaction to falling crime rates and a renewed attention to issues of racial injustice - could prove one of many hurdles for Mr. Biden if he decides to become a candidate for president.Already, in the 2016 presidential race, criminal justice has commanded a level of attention unseen since the 1990s and has compelled both Republicans and Democrats to have something new to say about it. For Mr. Biden to win support from the young voters who were critical to President Obama's election victories, according to activists like Jeremy Haile, he will need to show his views have evolved.'Any Democrat that is interested in gaining support among the current electorate, particularly the progressive civil rights communities, is going to have to say that previous tough-on-crime policies were a mistake,' said Mr. Haile, federal advocacy counsel at the Sentencing Project.Hillary Rodham Clinton, who in a sense faces the same challenge, addressed the issue in her first major policy speech as a candidate in April. Amid violent protests and riots in Baltimore, Mrs. Clinton made an emotional appeal to overhaul an 'out-of-balance' criminal justice system and end 'the era of mass incarceration.'A representative for the vice president said in a statement that Mr. Biden had always opposed certain 'elements of the law - like the three-strikes measure - that he did not think would function as their proponents intended.' And he felt that other parts of the law, like relief from mandatory minimum sentences for certain first-time nonviolent drug offenders, should have gone further, the representative said.The vice president's office also said Mr. Biden had played a 'critical' role in the Obama administration's continuing efforts to overhaul the system, meeting with members of Congress and participating in 'high-level staff discussions.'In a sign of the shifting mood, former President Bill Clinton, who long viewed the crime legislation as a major achievement of his administration, told the national convention of the N.A.A.C.P. in July that it in fact went too far in toughening sentencing standards and thus contributed to mass incarceration, a once controversial term now widely used.'I signed a bill that made the problem worse,' Mr. Clinton said. 'And I want to admit it.'Despite reservations, Mr. Biden, who has served as the Obama administration's unofficial liaison to the law enforcement community, has not only stood by the 1994 legislation, but has also frequently taken credit for it. As recently as this spring, in an essay on community policing for a book of bipartisan reform proposals put together by the Brennan Center for Justice, Mr. Biden referred to the legislation as the '1994 Biden Crime Bill.'Mr. Clinton wrote in a foreword to the book that 'our nation has too many people in prison and for too long - we have overshot the mark.' Mr. Biden, in contrast, stressed the success of the bill's community policing measures, which he said had achieved their goals before funding was cut.And in an interview with Time magazine in February 2014, he said, 'I am not only the guy who did the crime bill and the drug czar, but I'm also the guy who spent years when I was chairman of the Judiciary Committee and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee trying to change drug policy relative to cocaine, for example, crack and powder.'Activists say it would take an acknowledgment by Mr. Biden similar to Mr. and Mrs. Clinton's to begin to get the ear of the young minority voters so crucial to Mr. Obama's coalition.'Many of us who grew up in the black community in the '90s,' said Patrisse Cullors, a political organizer and co-founder of the Black Lives Matter movement, 'we witnessed the wave in which the policies that came from both federal government but also local government tore our families apart.''I think that any person coming to office who was really a part of that is going to have to deal with a large amount of criticism from those who were affected by this policy,' she said.Just as important, Ms. Cullors said, is for candidates to offer concrete proposals to roll back policies that have contributed to racial disparities in the criminal justice system and replace them with new ones 'that are about valuing black life.'Those are very different terms from those that filled the national conversation during Mr. Biden's tenure as Judiciary Committee chairman from 1987 to 1995, a period when Democrats fought hard to revise a caricature of the party as soft on crime.The 1994 crime bill provided tens of billions of dollars to put thousands of additional police on the streets, build new prisons, increase border protection, and fund crime prevention programs. It included several measures - including the Violence Against Women Act and a federal ban on certain assault weapons - that remain popular among many Democrats.But it also eliminated Pell Grants for prison inmates, criminalized gang membership, contained $9.7 billion in funding for new prisons, established a three-strikes provision that mandated life sentences for people with two or more prior convictions found to have committed a violent felony, and gave states incentives to lengthen sentences. These measures, many experts now say, helped give the United States the highest incarceration rate in the world.Today, about 2.2 million Americans are locked up in federal and state prisons and local jails, twice as many as when Mr. Clinton took office.Aides from Mr. Biden's time on the Judiciary Committee said that he had to make compromises, including on sentencing disparities between cases involving powder cocaine and those involving crack cocaine, which disproportionately affected African-Americans, to ensure the passage of otherwise good legislation. They also said that by the time the 1994 bill was drafted, Mr. Biden had come to oppose mandatory minimum sentencing.In 2007, during his last presidential bid, Mr. Biden introduced legislation that would have eased that disparity. The following year he offered another bill that aimed to confront systematic racial inequities. Neither measure passed, though another Biden-backed bill that provided increased resources to ease former offenders' re-entry into the community, the Second Chance Act, was enacted around the same time.Brittany Packnett, a St. Louis-based activist who is a member of Mr. Obama's 21st Century Policing task force, said that when she and other activists met with Mr. Biden and other White House officials last December, it was apparent that the vice president understood the urgency of the issue.'People at their best always evolve,' Ms. Packnett said. 'But we need to be told the story of that evolution. This needs to be clarified for us such that any plan that he puts forward addressing this would be seen as believable.'

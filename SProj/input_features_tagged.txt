When Ready for Hillary , a pro-Hillary Rodham Clinton ` super PAC , ' wanted to take out a million-dollar loan five months before it planned to go out of business , it turned to a bank that was founded to guard the savings of New York City garment workers.When the Democracy Alliance , an influential club of liberal donors , sought to recruit members in advance of the 2016 elections , the bank 's president helped to make introductions.And when workers-rights groups wanted to embarrass Walmart and the Gap for unsafe working conditions at factories supplying their stores , Amalgamated Bank , which manages $ 40 billion in pension fund assets , stepped in again , rounding up fellow investors to warn the companies that they could face lawsuits and shareholder actions.Four years after nearly collapsing amid the financial crisis , Amalgamated has aggressively carved out a position as the left 's private banker , leveraging deep connections with the Democratic establishment to expand rapidly in a niche long dominated by larger but less nimble financial institutions.The bank 's rise has been driven not only by the pace and complexity of modern campaigns , which demand increasingly specialized financial services , but by their vastly expanded scale : Billion-dollar presidential campaigns are expected for both parties in 2016 , bolstered by super PACs raising hundreds of millions of dollars more.And with Republican outside groups raising substantially more than their left-leaning counterparts this year , Democratic strategists viewed Amalgamated as a tool to leverage the financial clout of labor unions and left-leaning philanthropists.Founded and still principally owned by labor unions , the 92-year-old bank has signed up hundreds of new political clients , including most of the Democratic Party 's major committees , the progressive organizations that align with them , and several of their top Senate recruits.This spring , Amalgamated scored its biggest coup yet , winning the main business for Mrs. Clinton 's presidential campaign , which is likely to raise a billion dollars or more.Campaign clients have access to a 24-hour concierge service , staffed by veterans of President Obama 's campaigns , to handle last-minute media buys or reconcile election paperwork.Because it knows their donor world , Amalgamated is willing to advance cash on new contributions , almost immediately .

A fast-talking and born-again veteran of conservative politics with experience in Washington , Texas and California , Mr. Lane , 60 , travels the country trying to persuade evangelical clergy members to become politically active.His hope is that the politicized pastors will help mobilize congregations that have been disheartened by the repeated failure of socially conservative candidates , and by a party that has softened its opposition to same-sex marriage.It is an organizing approach far different from those in the days when larger-than-life leaders like the Moral Majority founder , Jerry Falwell , who died in 2007 , or Pat Robertson , now 84 , could activate evangelical voters simply by anointing a candidate.But close observers of evangelicals and their political involvement say Mr. Lane is emblematic of a new generation of evangelical leaders who draw local support or exert influence through niche issues or their own networks.Unlike political operatives such as Ralph Reed , the former executive director of the Christian Coalition who helped elect George W. Bush before becoming ensnared in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal , Mr. Lane does not have an extensive organization.What Mr. Lane , a former public relations man , does have going for him is a decentralized landscape in which a determined believer with an extensive network of ground-level evangelical leaders and a limitless capacity for talking on the phone can exert influence on Republican presidential candidates eager to reach evangelical voters .

A fast-talking and born-again veteran of conservative politics with experience in Washington , Texas and California , Mr. Lane , 60 , travels the country trying to persuade evangelical clergy members to become politically active.His hope is that the politicized pastors will help mobilize congregations that have been disheartened by the repeated failure of socially conservative candidates , and by a party that has softened its opposition to same-sex marriage.It is an organizing approach far different from those in the days when larger-than-life leaders like the Moral Majority founder , Jerry Falwell , who died in 2007 , or Pat Robertson , now 84 , could activate evangelical voters simply by anointing a candidate.But close observers of evangelicals and their political involvement say Mr. Lane is emblematic of a new generation of evangelical leaders who draw local support or exert influence through niche issues or their own networks.Unlike political operatives such as Ralph Reed , the former executive director of the Christian Coalition who helped elect George W. Bush before becoming ensnared in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal , Mr. Lane does not have an extensive organization.What Mr. Lane , a former public relations man , does have going for him is a decentralized landscape in which a determined believer with an extensive network of ground-level evangelical leaders and a limitless capacity for talking on the phone can exert influence on Republican presidential candidates eager to reach evangelical voters .

WASHINGTON - The $ 4 trillion budget that President Obama released Monday is more utopian vision than pragmatic blueprint for his final years in office , but buried in the document are kernels of proposals that could take root even with a hostile Republican Congress.In his penultimate budget , Mr. Obama proclaimed victory in the long climb from deep recession and said the time had come to loosen the strictures of austerity to invest in the nation 's future , laying out a plan likely to shape the 2016 presidential contests .

It 's very high energy , Donald , ' Mr. Bush said to laughs.Even Mr. Trump had to concede it was a good line , holding out his hand for Mr. Bush to slap , which he did with notable energy.The sparring reflected a calculation among several candidates that the forum offered their best opportunity yet to convince a sizable national audience that they were more credible alternatives to Mr. Trump , yet shared his passion and determination to change Washington.A record-setting 24 million people watched the first debate on Aug. 6 , and standout performances from four candidates - Mr. Trump , Mr. Carson , Mrs. Fiorina and Mr. Kasich - helped them make gains in opinion polls and draw greater news media attention in the six weeks that followed.Support for Mr. Trump has proved particularly durable in spite of his divisive remarks ; 39 percent of Republicans see him as their best chance of winning the 2016 election , according to a New York Times/CBS News poll released this week.Wednesday 's forum , held before a few hundred well-heeled Republicans at the hilltop shrine to one of the party 's most revered presidents , had been expected to have less of a gladiatorial feel than last month 's debate , which took place in a cavernous Cleveland arena where audience cheers and catcalls seemed to energize Mr. Trump and throw off others , like Mr. Carson.In a campaign that has been overwhelmed by a reality-show celebrity , it is perhaps fitting that these televised showdowns are becoming so consequential .

When Ready for Hillary , a pro-Hillary Rodham Clinton ` super PAC , ' wanted to take out a million-dollar loan five months before it planned to go out of business , it turned to a bank that was founded to guard the savings of New York City garment workers.When the Democracy Alliance , an influential club of liberal donors , sought to recruit members in advance of the 2016 elections , the bank 's president helped to make introductions.And when workers-rights groups wanted to embarrass Walmart and the Gap for unsafe working conditions at factories supplying their stores , Amalgamated Bank , which manages $ 40 billion in pension fund assets , stepped in again , rounding up fellow investors to warn the companies that they could face lawsuits and shareholder actions.Four years after nearly collapsing amid the financial crisis , Amalgamated has aggressively carved out a position as the left 's private banker , leveraging deep connections with the Democratic establishment to expand rapidly in a niche long dominated by larger but less nimble financial institutions.The bank 's rise has been driven not only by the pace and complexity of modern campaigns , which demand increasingly specialized financial services , but by their vastly expanded scale : Billion-dollar presidential campaigns are expected for both parties in 2016 , bolstered by super PACs raising hundreds of millions of dollars more.And with Republican outside groups raising substantially more than their left-leaning counterparts this year , Democratic strategists viewed Amalgamated as a tool to leverage the financial clout of labor unions and left-leaning philanthropists.Founded and still principally owned by labor unions , the 92-year-old bank has signed up hundreds of new political clients , including most of the Democratic Party 's major committees , the progressive organizations that align with them , and several of their top Senate recruits.This spring , Amalgamated scored its biggest coup yet , winning the main business for Mrs. Clinton 's presidential campaign , which is likely to raise a billion dollars or more.Campaign clients have access to a 24-hour concierge service , staffed by veterans of President Obama 's campaigns , to handle last-minute media buys or reconcile election paperwork.Because it knows their donor world , Amalgamated is willing to advance cash on new contributions , almost immediately .

When Ready for Hillary , a pro-Hillary Rodham Clinton ` super PAC , ' wanted to take out a million-dollar loan five months before it planned to go out of business , it turned to a bank that was founded to guard the savings of New York City garment workers.When the Democracy Alliance , an influential club of liberal donors , sought to recruit members in advance of the 2016 elections , the bank 's president helped to make introductions.And when workers-rights groups wanted to embarrass Walmart and the Gap for unsafe working conditions at factories supplying their stores , Amalgamated Bank , which manages $ 40 billion in pension fund assets , stepped in again , rounding up fellow investors to warn the companies that they could face lawsuits and shareholder actions.Four years after nearly collapsing amid the financial crisis , Amalgamated has aggressively carved out a position as the left 's private banker , leveraging deep connections with the Democratic establishment to expand rapidly in a niche long dominated by larger but less nimble financial institutions.The bank 's rise has been driven not only by the pace and complexity of modern campaigns , which demand increasingly specialized financial services , but by their vastly expanded scale : Billion-dollar presidential campaigns are expected for both parties in 2016 , bolstered by super PACs raising hundreds of millions of dollars more.And with Republican outside groups raising substantially more than their left-leaning counterparts this year , Democratic strategists viewed Amalgamated as a tool to leverage the financial clout of labor unions and left-leaning philanthropists.Founded and still principally owned by labor unions , the 92-year-old bank has signed up hundreds of new political clients , including most of the Democratic Party 's major committees , the progressive organizations that align with them , and several of their top Senate recruits.This spring , Amalgamated scored its biggest coup yet , winning the main business for Mrs. Clinton 's presidential campaign , which is likely to raise a billion dollars or more.Campaign clients have access to a 24-hour concierge service , staffed by veterans of President Obama 's campaigns , to handle last-minute media buys or reconcile election paperwork.Because it knows their donor world , Amalgamated is willing to advance cash on new contributions , almost immediately .

`` A Democrat familiar with Biden 's deliberations said recent discussions have focused on whether Biden 's family would be ready to pursue a third presidential campaign only months after the death of the vice president 's son , Beau Biden.Also under consideration is whether Biden can meet the basic criteria to be a serious contender , such as whether he would have a plausible path to victory in the campaign and whether he would be able to raise enough money to be competitive.The Democrat spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the private conversations.Biden 's trip to Florida , one of the nation 's premiere campaign battleground states , includes meetings with Jewish leaders on Thursday who are skeptical of Obama 's effort to win support for the nuclear deal with Iran.He then heads to Pittsburgh to march in a Labor Day parade on Monday with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka , who met privately with the vice president last week and says `` the field is still wide open '' if Biden decides to run.The travels mark the latest chapter in Biden 's deliberations , which have included private discussions with family members and longtime aides at his Delaware home and a Naval Observatory meeting with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , a popular liberal whose endorsement would be coveted by any Democratic candidate.Warren said Wednesday that she and Biden had `` a good long rambly policy conversation '' at the Naval Observatory .

At the same time , if two Republican governors , Scott Walker in Wisconsin and Rick Snyder in Michigan , win re-election , these two Midwestern states will shift in 2016 from the reliably Democratic column to competitive status.Details down to precinct level results in all the competitive races this year will be studied closely by party officials and political scientists to determine whether Republicans have caught up with Democrats in the world of big-data , high-tech voter mobilization.In the last two presidential elections , the Obama campaign and Democratic interest groups remained far ahead of Republicans in the so-called ground war techniques of locating favorable voters wherever they can be found , registering citizens likely to be supportive , and making sure every supporter casts a ballot , in person , by mail , or through early voting processes.In the current contest , however , both the Republican National Committee and the network of conservative groups allied with the Koch brothers have invested millions in microtargeting innovation , and are attempting to level the playing field.Estimates of the effectiveness of microtargeting vary , but , if the 2016 election is close , new digital strategies developed in recent years to marshal favorable voters will be crucial to the outcome.As the election campaign comes to a close , polls suggest that Republican candidates vulnerable to ` war on women ' accusations have learned how to successfully revamp.Senate candidates in Virginia , North Carolina and Colorado have adopted the strategy of signaling support for women 's reproductive rights by pointedly endorsing access to over-the-counter ` morning after ' contraceptive pills.Representative Cory Gardner , the Republican challenging Senator Mark Udall of Colorado , has not only called for the availability of the day-after pill , he has repudiated his past support for a ` personhood ' constitutional amendment that would effectively ban all abortions .

When Ready for Hillary , a pro-Hillary Rodham Clinton ` super PAC , ' wanted to take out a million-dollar loan five months before it planned to go out of business , it turned to a bank that was founded to guard the savings of New York City garment workers.When the Democracy Alliance , an influential club of liberal donors , sought to recruit members in advance of the 2016 elections , the bank 's president helped to make introductions.And when workers-rights groups wanted to embarrass Walmart and the Gap for unsafe working conditions at factories supplying their stores , Amalgamated Bank , which manages $ 40 billion in pension fund assets , stepped in again , rounding up fellow investors to warn the companies that they could face lawsuits and shareholder actions.Four years after nearly collapsing amid the financial crisis , Amalgamated has aggressively carved out a position as the left 's private banker , leveraging deep connections with the Democratic establishment to expand rapidly in a niche long dominated by larger but less nimble financial institutions.The bank 's rise has been driven not only by the pace and complexity of modern campaigns , which demand increasingly specialized financial services , but by their vastly expanded scale : Billion-dollar presidential campaigns are expected for both parties in 2016 , bolstered by super PACs raising hundreds of millions of dollars more.And with Republican outside groups raising substantially more than their left-leaning counterparts this year , Democratic strategists viewed Amalgamated as a tool to leverage the financial clout of labor unions and left-leaning philanthropists.Founded and still principally owned by labor unions , the 92-year-old bank has signed up hundreds of new political clients , including most of the Democratic Party 's major committees , the progressive organizations that align with them , and several of their top Senate recruits.This spring , Amalgamated scored its biggest coup yet , winning the main business for Mrs. Clinton 's presidential campaign , which is likely to raise a billion dollars or more.Campaign clients have access to a 24-hour concierge service , staffed by veterans of President Obama 's campaigns , to handle last-minute media buys or reconcile election paperwork.Because it knows their donor world , Amalgamated is willing to advance cash on new contributions , almost immediately .

`` A Democrat familiar with Biden 's deliberations said recent discussions have focused on whether Biden 's family would be ready to pursue a third presidential campaign only months after the death of the vice president 's son , Beau Biden.Also under consideration is whether Biden can meet the basic criteria to be a serious contender , such as whether he would have a plausible path to victory in the campaign and whether he would be able to raise enough money to be competitive.The Democrat spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the private conversations.Biden 's trip to Florida , one of the nation 's premiere campaign battleground states , includes meetings with Jewish leaders on Thursday who are skeptical of Obama 's effort to win support for the nuclear deal with Iran.He then heads to Pittsburgh to march in a Labor Day parade on Monday with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka , who met privately with the vice president last week and says `` the field is still wide open '' if Biden decides to run.The travels mark the latest chapter in Biden 's deliberations , which have included private discussions with family members and longtime aides at his Delaware home and a Naval Observatory meeting with Massachusetts Sen.

At the same time , if two Republican governors , Scott Walker in Wisconsin and Rick Snyder in Michigan , win re-election , these two Midwestern states will shift in 2016 from the reliably Democratic column to competitive status.Details down to precinct level results in all the competitive races this year will be studied closely by party officials and political scientists to determine whether Republicans have caught up with Democrats in the world of big-data , high-tech voter mobilization.In the last two presidential elections , the Obama campaign and Democratic interest groups remained far ahead of Republicans in the so-called ground war techniques of locating favorable voters wherever they can be found , registering citizens likely to be supportive , and making sure every supporter casts a ballot , in person , by mail , or through early voting processes.In the current contest , however , both the Republican National Committee and the network of conservative groups allied with the Koch brothers have invested millions in microtargeting innovation , and are attempting to level the playing field.Estimates of the effectiveness of microtargeting vary , but , if the 2016 election is close , new digital strategies developed in recent years to marshal favorable voters will be crucial to the outcome.As the election campaign comes to a close , polls suggest that Republican candidates vulnerable to ` war on women ' accusations have learned how to successfully revamp.Senate candidates in Virginia , North Carolina and Colorado have adopted the strategy of signaling support for women 's reproductive rights by pointedly endorsing access to over-the-counter ` morning after ' contraceptive pills.Representative Cory Gardner , the Republican challenging Senator Mark Udall of Colorado , has not only called for the availability of the day-after pill , he has repudiated his past support for a ` personhood ' constitutional amendment that would effectively ban all abortions .

At the same time , if two Republican governors , Scott Walker in Wisconsin and Rick Snyder in Michigan , win re-election , these two Midwestern states will shift in 2016 from the reliably Democratic column to competitive status.Details down to precinct level results in all the competitive races this year will be studied closely by party officials and political scientists to determine whether Republicans have caught up with Democrats in the world of big-data , high-tech voter mobilization.In the last two presidential elections , the Obama campaign and Democratic interest groups remained far ahead of Republicans in the so-called ground war techniques of locating favorable voters wherever they can be found , registering citizens likely to be supportive , and making sure every supporter casts a ballot , in person , by mail , or through early voting processes.In the current contest , however , both the Republican National Committee and the network of conservative groups allied with the Koch brothers have invested millions in microtargeting innovation , and are attempting to level the playing field.Estimates of the effectiveness of microtargeting vary , but , if the 2016 election is close , new digital strategies developed in recent years to marshal favorable voters will be crucial to the outcome.As the election campaign comes to a close , polls suggest that Republican candidates vulnerable to ` war on women ' accusations have learned how to successfully revamp.Senate candidates in Virginia , North Carolina and Colorado have adopted the strategy of signaling support for women 's reproductive rights by pointedly endorsing access to over-the-counter ` morning after ' contraceptive pills.Representative Cory Gardner , the Republican challenging Senator Mark Udall of Colorado , has not only called for the availability of the day-after pill , he has repudiated his past support for a ` personhood ' constitutional amendment that would effectively ban all abortions .

`` A Democrat familiar with Biden 's deliberations said recent discussions have focused on whether Biden 's family would be ready to pursue a third presidential campaign only months after the death of the vice president 's son , Beau Biden.Also under consideration is whether Biden can meet the basic criteria to be a serious contender , such as whether he would have a plausible path to victory in the campaign and whether he would be able to raise enough money to be competitive.The Democrat spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the private conversations.Biden 's trip to Florida , one of the nation 's premiere campaign battleground states , includes meetings with Jewish leaders on Thursday who are skeptical of Obama 's effort to win support for the nuclear deal with Iran.He then heads to Pittsburgh to march in a Labor Day parade on Monday with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka , who met privately with the vice president last week and says `` the field is still wide open '' if Biden decides to run.The travels mark the latest chapter in Biden 's deliberations , which have included private discussions with family members and longtime aides at his Delaware home and a Naval Observatory meeting with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , a popular liberal whose endorsement would be coveted by any Democratic candidate.Warren said Wednesday that she and Biden had `` a good long rambly policy conversation '' at the Naval Observatory .

When Ready for Hillary , a pro-Hillary Rodham Clinton ` super PAC , ' wanted to take out a million-dollar loan five months before it planned to go out of business , it turned to a bank that was founded to guard the savings of New York City garment workers.When the Democracy Alliance , an influential club of liberal donors , sought to recruit members in advance of the 2016 elections , the bank 's president helped to make introductions.And when workers-rights groups wanted to embarrass Walmart and the Gap for unsafe working conditions at factories supplying their stores , Amalgamated Bank , which manages $ 40 billion in pension fund assets , stepped in again , rounding up fellow investors to warn the companies that they could face lawsuits and shareholder actions.Four years after nearly collapsing amid the financial crisis , Amalgamated has aggressively carved out a position as the left 's private banker , leveraging deep connections with the Democratic establishment to expand rapidly in a niche long dominated by larger but less nimble financial institutions.The bank 's rise has been driven not only by the pace and complexity of modern campaigns , which demand increasingly specialized financial services , but by their vastly expanded scale : Billion-dollar presidential campaigns are expected for both parties in 2016 , bolstered by super PACs raising hundreds of millions of dollars more.And with Republican outside groups raising substantially more than their left-leaning counterparts this year , Democratic strategists viewed Amalgamated as a tool to leverage the financial clout of labor unions and left-leaning philanthropists.Founded and still principally owned by labor unions , the 92-year-old bank has signed up hundreds of new political clients , including most of the Democratic Party 's major committees , the progressive organizations that align with them , and several of their top Senate recruits.This spring , Amalgamated scored its biggest coup yet , winning the main business for Mrs. Clinton 's presidential campaign , which is likely to raise a billion dollars or more.Campaign clients have access to a 24-hour concierge service , staffed by veterans of President Obama 's campaigns , to handle last-minute media buys or reconcile election paperwork.Because it knows their donor world , Amalgamated is willing to advance cash on new contributions , almost immediately .

` His lack of knowledge in the foreign policy area has been a problem because , well , you want your commander in chief to be confident on those issues , ' said Bruce Perlo , chairman of the Grafton County Republican Committee in New Hampshire.Recognizing the problem , Mr. Walker has joined in hourslong meetings in Washington ; Madison , Wis. ; and elsewhere for tutorials on the Islamic State , Iran , Russia and military and geopolitical confrontations , as well as human rights abuses , border security and immigration policy , and other issues , advisers said.He has relied on Republicans such as former Senator Jim Talent of Missouri , who leads Mr. Walker 's national security advisory council , and Andrew Bremberg , his policy director , who previously was a top aide to the Senate majority leader , Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.In recent months , Mr. Walker has also met or spoken with Prime Ministers Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel as part of a trip to Israel , David Cameron of Britain and Stephen Harper of Canada ; Presidents Xi Jinping of China and Toomas Hendrik Ilves of Estonia ; retired military leaders such as former Gen. David H. Petraeus and former Gen. Jack Keane ; and a number of American and foreign ambassadors.Aides to Mr. Walker provided this list in response to questions about his briefings ; they declined a request to interview Mr. Walker.General Keane , in an email , said he had provided an analysis of global security challenges facing the United States , which he has done for several other candidates from both parties .

It 's very high energy , Donald , ' Mr. Bush said to laughs.Even Mr. Trump had to concede it was a good line , holding out his hand for Mr. Bush to slap , which he did with notable energy.The sparring reflected a calculation among several candidates that the forum offered their best opportunity yet to convince a sizable national audience that they were more credible alternatives to Mr. Trump , yet shared his passion and determination to change Washington.A record-setting 24 million people watched the first debate on Aug. 6 , and standout performances from four candidates - Mr. Trump , Mr. Carson , Mrs. Fiorina and Mr. Kasich - helped them make gains in opinion polls and draw greater news media attention in the six weeks that followed.Support for Mr. Trump has proved particularly durable in spite of his divisive remarks ; 39 percent of Republicans see him as their best chance of winning the 2016 election , according to a New York Times/CBS News poll released this week.Wednesday 's forum , held before a few hundred well-heeled Republicans at the hilltop shrine to one of the party 's most revered presidents , had been expected to have less of a gladiatorial feel than last month 's debate , which took place in a cavernous Cleveland arena where audience cheers and catcalls seemed to energize Mr. Trump and throw off others , like Mr. Carson.In a campaign that has been overwhelmed by a reality-show celebrity , it is perhaps fitting that these televised showdowns are becoming so consequential .

To win the presidency , Republicans clearly need to improve their numbers among women , but their approach on reproductive issues appears likely to make that goal difficult.Further compounding the hurdles facing Republicans are the party 's current drive to defund Planned Parenthood , and the sustained effort to reduce the number of abortion clinics in Republican-controlled states.This effort includes legislation effectively closing such clinics by requiring , in the case of Texas , that ' a physician performing or inducing an abortion must , on the date the abortion is performed , have active admitting privileges at a hospital that is located not further than 30 miles from the location at which the abortion is performed , ' and that abortion facilities must meet the ` minimum standards for ambulatory surgical centers ' ; requiring women to undergo sometimes invasive ultrasound procedures before being allowed to have an abortion ; and imposing restrictions on abortion coverage in private health insurance plans.The conflicts over reproductive rights within both the Republican Party and within the social conservative movement are inevitable .

It 's very high energy , Donald , ' Mr. Bush said to laughs.Even Mr. Trump had to concede it was a good line , holding out his hand for Mr. Bush to slap , which he did with notable energy.The sparring reflected a calculation among several candidates that the forum offered their best opportunity yet to convince a sizable national audience that they were more credible alternatives to Mr. Trump , yet shared his passion and determination to change Washington.A record-setting 24 million people watched the first debate on Aug. 6 , and standout performances from four candidates - Mr. Trump , Mr. Carson , Mrs. Fiorina and Mr. Kasich - helped them make gains in opinion polls and draw greater news media attention in the six weeks that followed.Support for Mr. Trump has proved particularly durable in spite of his divisive remarks ; 39 percent of Republicans see him as their best chance of winning the 2016 election , according to a New York Times/CBS News poll released this week.Wednesday 's forum , held before a few hundred well-heeled Republicans at the hilltop shrine to one of the party 's most revered presidents , had been expected to have less of a gladiatorial feel than last month 's debate , which took place in a cavernous Cleveland arena where audience cheers and catcalls seemed to energize Mr. Trump and throw off others , like Mr. Carson.In a campaign that has been overwhelmed by a reality-show celebrity , it is perhaps fitting that these televised showdowns are becoming so consequential .

It 's very high energy , Donald , ' Mr. Bush said to laughs.Even Mr. Trump had to concede it was a good line , holding out his hand for Mr. Bush to slap , which he did with notable energy.The sparring reflected a calculation among several candidates that the forum offered their best opportunity yet to convince a sizable national audience that they were more credible alternatives to Mr. Trump , yet shared his passion and determination to change Washington.A record-setting 24 million people watched the first debate on Aug. 6 , and standout performances from four candidates - Mr. Trump , Mr. Carson , Mrs. Fiorina and Mr. Kasich - helped them make gains in opinion polls and draw greater news media attention in the six weeks that followed.Support for Mr. Trump has proved particularly durable in spite of his divisive remarks ; 39 percent of Republicans see him as their best chance of winning the 2016 election , according to a New York Times/CBS News poll released this week.Wednesday 's forum , held before a few hundred well-heeled Republicans at the hilltop shrine to one of the party 's most revered presidents , had been expected to have less of a gladiatorial feel than last month 's debate , which took place in a cavernous Cleveland arena where audience cheers and catcalls seemed to energize Mr. Trump and throw off others , like Mr. Carson.In a campaign that has been overwhelmed by a reality-show celebrity , it is perhaps fitting that these televised showdowns are becoming so consequential .

` In an interview on ` Fox & Friends ' a few days after Mr. Stone 's departure from the campaign , Mr. Trump said , ` Roger Stone is a nice guy , but I let him go because I really was n't using him and he liked to get a lot of publicity for himself , which I did n't want .

` The document is undergirded by two major presidential initiatives that have virtually no chance in Congress : large tax increases on multinational corporations and the rich , and a comprehensive immigration law that would lift the economy with millions of newly legalized , taxpaying workers.The proceeds of those initiatives would pay for free community college , more generous child care subsidies and education tax credits , paid sick leave , expanded unemployment benefits , and tax credits for two-earner middle-class couples , among other offerings.The White House even did away with the usual plain blue budget document cover for a gritty black-and-white photo of the Tappan Zee Bridge in New York , making vivid the president 's emphasis on ' a 21st-century infrastructure that creates jobs for thousands of construction workers and engineers , connects hard-working Americans to their jobs , and makes it easier for businesses to transport goods , ' as Mr. Obama wrote in the opening budget message.The push reflects the degree to which Mr. Obama emerged from last year 's midterm election losses determined to reinforce - rather than scale back - his belief that the government should play a fundamental role in spreading economic prosperity .

Bush before becoming ensnared in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal , Mr. Lane does not have an extensive organization.What Mr. Lane , a former public relations man , does have going for him is a decentralized landscape in which a determined believer with an extensive network of ground-level evangelical leaders and a limitless capacity for talking on the phone can exert influence on Republican presidential candidates eager to reach evangelical voters .

A fast-talking and born-again veteran of conservative politics with experience in Washington , Texas and California , Mr. Lane , 60 , travels the country trying to persuade evangelical clergy members to become politically active.His hope is that the politicized pastors will help mobilize congregations that have been disheartened by the repeated failure of socially conservative candidates , and by a party that has softened its opposition to same-sex marriage.It is an organizing approach far different from those in the days when larger-than-life leaders like the Moral Majority founder , Jerry Falwell , who died in 2007 , or Pat Robertson , now 84 , could activate evangelical voters simply by anointing a candidate.But close observers of evangelicals and their political involvement say Mr. Lane is emblematic of a new generation of evangelical leaders who draw local support or exert influence through niche issues or their own networks.Unlike political operatives such as Ralph Reed , the former executive director of the Christian Coalition who helped elect George W. Bush before becoming ensnared in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal , Mr. Lane does not have an extensive organization.What Mr. Lane , a former public relations man , does have going for him is a decentralized landscape in which a determined believer with an extensive network of ground-level evangelical leaders and a limitless capacity for talking on the phone can exert influence on Republican presidential candidates eager to reach evangelical voters .

Confusion among European leaders about how to deal with the crisis raises questions about the political unity that is essential to the survival of the eurozone.These factors could undermine the positive effects of the bond-buying stimulus program , known as quantitative easing , that the European Central Bank began in March as a way to pump money into the eurozone economy and force down market interest rates.As a result , some analysts , so far apparently a minority , expect Mr. Draghi to send a strong signal on Thursday that the central bank 's Governing Council is ready to step up its bond purchases and continue them longer than currently planned.But any talk of more stimulus would reawaken tensions on the Governing Council between those who think the central bank has already done too much and those who favor aggressive , pre-emptive action .

The paucity of fresh faces even gave rise to a joking Twitter hashtag : #Dukakis 2016 , offering up the party 's 1988 nominee , former Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.Still , Mr. Biden , Mr. Kerry and Mr. Gore have lost presidential bids before and are hardly guaranteed party saviors - or more popular than Mrs. Clinton among important demographic groups like women , African-Americans and Hispanics.Indeed , for all of the talk about 2016 fallback plans , Mrs. Clinton remains the front-runner for the nomination , and her comments on Tuesday in an interview with ABC News and in a follow-up message to supporters - saying ` I 'm sorry ' for relying on private email for government business as secretary of state and calling that practice ' a mistake ' - may help assuage concerns among some Democrats about her candidacy.But the chatter could continue if Mrs. Clinton does not quickly regain her footing .

He said he would not accept spending bills that maintained tough budget caps he agreed to in 2011 , nor would he loosen budget controls on military spending without relaxing them for domestic programs.But hidden in some of his most ambitious proposals to diminish the wealth gap and remake the corporate tax code are areas of potential compromise that nod to Republican ideas : an expansion of the earned income credit for the working poor , a revitalized Pentagon budget , and a surge in spending on roads , bridges , airports and other infrastructure , financed by a new tax rate on foreign corporate profits.Absent from the plan is any pretense of remaking the main drivers of the long-term debt - Social Security and Medicare - a quest that has long eluded both parties .

Confusion among European leaders about how to deal with the crisis raises questions about the political unity that is essential to the survival of the eurozone.These factors could undermine the positive effects of the bond-buying stimulus program , known as quantitative easing , that the European Central Bank began in March as a way to pump money into the eurozone economy and force down market interest rates.As a result , some analysts , so far apparently a minority , expect Mr. Draghi to send a strong signal on Thursday that the central bank 's Governing Council is ready to step up its bond purchases and continue them longer than currently planned.But any talk of more stimulus would reawaken tensions on the Governing Council between those who think the central bank has already done too much and those who favor aggressive , pre-emptive action .

So far , the Electoral Commission 's recommendations would increase the representation of less populated rural areas relative to that of more populated urban areas , which favors BN because it tends to fare better than the opposition in Sarawak 's rural parts.A member of the state assembly from the People 's Justice Party and an individual representing a group of voters have challenged the Sarawak redistricting in court , claiming , among other things , that its lack of transparency violates their constitutional rights .

It 's very high energy , Donald , ' Mr. Bush said to laughs.Even Mr. Trump had to concede it was a good line , holding out his hand for Mr. Bush to slap , which he did with notable energy.The sparring reflected a calculation among several candidates that the forum offered their best opportunity yet to convince a sizable national audience that they were more credible alternatives to Mr. Trump , yet shared his passion and determination to change Washington.A record-setting 24 million people watched the first debate on Aug. 6 , and standout performances from four candidates - Mr. Trump , Mr. Carson , Mrs. Fiorina and Mr. Kasich - helped them make gains in opinion polls and draw greater news media attention in the six weeks that followed.Support for Mr. Trump has proved particularly durable in spite of his divisive remarks ; 39 percent of Republicans see him as their best chance of winning the 2016 election , according to a New York Times/CBS News poll released this week.Wednesday 's forum , held before a few hundred well-heeled Republicans at the hilltop shrine to one of the party 's most revered presidents , had been expected to have less of a gladiatorial feel than last month 's debate , which took place in a cavernous Cleveland arena where audience cheers and catcalls seemed to energize Mr. Trump and throw off others , like Mr. Carson.In a campaign that has been overwhelmed by a reality-show celebrity , it is perhaps fitting that these televised showdowns are becoming so consequential .

`` A Democrat familiar with Biden 's deliberations said recent discussions have focused on whether Biden 's family would be ready to pursue a third presidential campaign only months after the death of the vice president 's son , Beau Biden.Also under consideration is whether Biden can meet the basic criteria to be a serious contender , such as whether he would have a plausible path to victory in the campaign and whether he would be able to raise enough money to be competitive.The Democrat spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the private conversations.Biden 's trip to Florida , one of the nation 's premiere campaign battleground states , includes meetings with Jewish leaders on Thursday who are skeptical of Obama 's effort to win support for the nuclear deal with Iran.He then heads to Pittsburgh to march in a Labor Day parade on Monday with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka , who met privately with the vice president last week and says `` the field is still wide open '' if Biden decides to run.The travels mark the latest chapter in Biden 's deliberations , which have included private discussions with family members and longtime aides at his Delaware home and a Naval Observatory meeting with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , a popular liberal whose endorsement would be coveted by any Democratic candidate.Warren said Wednesday that she and Biden had `` a good long rambly policy conversation '' at the Naval Observatory .

It 's very high energy , Donald , ' Mr. Bush said to laughs.Even Mr. Trump had to concede it was a good line , holding out his hand for Mr. Bush to slap , which he did with notable energy.The sparring reflected a calculation among several candidates that the forum offered their best opportunity yet to convince a sizable national audience that they were more credible alternatives to Mr. Trump , yet shared his passion and determination to change Washington.A record-setting 24 million people watched the first debate on Aug. 6 , and standout performances from four candidates - Mr. Trump , Mr. Carson , Mrs. Fiorina and Mr. Kasich - helped them make gains in opinion polls and draw greater news media attention in the six weeks that followed.Support for Mr. Trump has proved particularly durable in spite of his divisive remarks ; 39 percent of Republicans see him as their best chance of winning the 2016 election , according to a New York Times/CBS News poll released this week.Wednesday 's forum , held before a few hundred well-heeled Republicans at the hilltop shrine to one of the party 's most revered presidents , had been expected to have less of a gladiatorial feel than last month 's debate , which took place in a cavernous Cleveland arena where audience cheers and catcalls seemed to energize Mr. Trump and throw off others , like Mr. Carson.In a campaign that has been overwhelmed by a reality-show celebrity , it is perhaps fitting that these televised showdowns are becoming so consequential .

David H. Petraeus and former Gen.

`` What 's clear is that today 's voters endorse Reagan 's legacy , however they see it.In a 2014 Quinnipiac University poll , 35 percent of voters nationally chose Reagan as the best president the United States has had since World War II - well ahead of Bill Clinton 18 percent and John Kennedy 15 percent.Among Republicans , Reagan was the runaway favorite , with 66 percent picking him as the top president in recent history.That 's perhaps why opponents of the GOP White House hopefuls are also sometimes eager to stand the candidates up next to Reagan.In an online ad posted Wednesday , the super PAC backing Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton 's campaign spliced some of the GOP contenders ' comments into Reagan 's famous `` Morning in America '' TV ad from his 1984 campaign.After the narrator from the original ad says , `` It 's morning again in America , '' the ad cuts to Trump at a podium saying , `` Sadly , the American dream is dead .

And as we 've reported previously , the data on wages in 2015 so far does not suggest there is a meaningful acceleration on the way.A drop in the price of oil , though , has created a short-term drop in inflation numbers that may create a temporary bump in inflation-adjusted incomes for 2015 anyway.The depressing data on middle-class wages is true across almost all groups based on race and age .

A fast-talking and born-again veteran of conservative politics with experience in Washington , Texas and California , Mr. Lane , 60 , travels the country trying to persuade evangelical clergy members to become politically active.His hope is that the politicized pastors will help mobilize congregations that have been disheartened by the repeated failure of socially conservative candidates , and by a party that has softened its opposition to same-sex marriage.It is an organizing approach far different from those in the days when larger-than-life leaders like the Moral Majority founder , Jerry Falwell , who died in 2007 , or Pat Robertson , now 84 , could activate evangelical voters simply by anointing a candidate.But close observers of evangelicals and their political involvement say Mr. Lane is emblematic of a new generation of evangelical leaders who draw local support or exert influence through niche issues or their own networks.Unlike political operatives such as Ralph Reed , the former executive director of the Christian Coalition who helped elect George W. Bush before becoming ensnared in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal , Mr. Lane does not have an extensive organization.What Mr. Lane , a former public relations man , does have going for him is a decentralized landscape in which a determined believer with an extensive network of ground-level evangelical leaders and a limitless capacity for talking on the phone can exert influence on Republican presidential candidates eager to reach evangelical voters .

It 's very high energy , Donald , ' Mr. Bush said to laughs.Even Mr. Trump had to concede it was a good line , holding out his hand for Mr. Bush to slap , which he did with notable energy.The sparring reflected a calculation among several candidates that the forum offered their best opportunity yet to convince a sizable national audience that they were more credible alternatives to Mr. Trump , yet shared his passion and determination to change Washington.A record-setting 24 million people watched the first debate on Aug. 6 , and standout performances from four candidates - Mr. Trump , Mr. Carson , Mrs. Fiorina and Mr. Kasich - helped them make gains in opinion polls and draw greater news media attention in the six weeks that followed.Support for Mr. Trump has proved particularly durable in spite of his divisive remarks ; 39 percent of Republicans see him as their best chance of winning the 2016 election , according to a New York Times/CBS News poll released this week.Wednesday 's forum , held before a few hundred well-heeled Republicans at the hilltop shrine to one of the party 's most revered presidents , had been expected to have less of a gladiatorial feel than last month 's debate , which took place in a cavernous Cleveland arena where audience cheers and catcalls seemed to energize Mr. Trump and throw off others , like Mr. Carson.In a campaign that has been overwhelmed by a reality-show celebrity , it is perhaps fitting that these televised showdowns are becoming so consequential .

He said he would not accept spending bills that maintained tough budget caps he agreed to in 2011 , nor would he loosen budget controls on military spending without relaxing them for domestic programs.But hidden in some of his most ambitious proposals to diminish the wealth gap and remake the corporate tax code are areas of potential compromise that nod to Republican ideas : an expansion of the earned income credit for the working poor , a revitalized Pentagon budget , and a surge in spending on roads , bridges , airports and other infrastructure , financed by a new tax rate on foreign corporate profits.Absent from the plan is any pretense of remaking the main drivers of the long-term debt - Social Security and Medicare - a quest that has long eluded both parties .

It 's very high energy , Donald , ' Mr. Bush said to laughs.Even Mr. Trump had to concede it was a good line , holding out his hand for Mr. Bush to slap , which he did with notable energy.The sparring reflected a calculation among several candidates that the forum offered their best opportunity yet to convince a sizable national audience that they were more credible alternatives to Mr. Trump , yet shared his passion and determination to change Washington.A record-setting 24 million people watched the first debate on Aug. 6 , and standout performances from four candidates - Mr. Trump , Mr. Carson , Mrs. Fiorina and Mr. Kasich - helped them make gains in opinion polls and draw greater news media attention in the six weeks that followed.Support for Mr. Trump has proved particularly durable in spite of his divisive remarks ; 39 percent of Republicans see him as their best chance of winning the 2016 election , according to a New York Times/CBS News poll released this week.Wednesday 's forum , held before a few hundred well-heeled Republicans at the hilltop shrine to one of the party 's most revered presidents , had been expected to have less of a gladiatorial feel than last month 's debate , which took place in a cavernous Cleveland arena where audience cheers and catcalls seemed to energize Mr. Trump and throw off others , like Mr. Carson.In a campaign that has been overwhelmed by a reality-show celebrity , it is perhaps fitting that these televised showdowns are becoming so consequential .

WASHINGTON - Since the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , American counterterrorism officials have increased security at national landmarks and large public events ahead of major holidays or significant anniversaries , and issued bulletins calling for increased vigilance by the public.But this Fourth of July weekend has spawned particularly strong warnings about a potential attack as the federal authorities and national security experts say the United States is more susceptible now because of tactics chosen for recent terrorist strikes by the Islamic State.Officials cite an increased effort by the Islamic State to galvanize its sympathizers in the United States and elsewhere since Memorial Day and during this Ramadan season to carry out acts of violence on their own - so-called lone-wolf attacks .

When Ready for Hillary , a pro-Hillary Rodham Clinton ` super PAC , ' wanted to take out a million-dollar loan five months before it planned to go out of business , it turned to a bank that was founded to guard the savings of New York City garment workers.When the Democracy Alliance , an influential club of liberal donors , sought to recruit members in advance of the 2016 elections , the bank 's president helped to make introductions.And when workers-rights groups wanted to embarrass Walmart and the Gap for unsafe working conditions at factories supplying their stores , Amalgamated Bank , which manages $ 40 billion in pension fund assets , stepped in again , rounding up fellow investors to warn the companies that they could face lawsuits and shareholder actions.Four years after nearly collapsing amid the financial crisis , Amalgamated has aggressively carved out a position as the left 's private banker , leveraging deep connections with the Democratic establishment to expand rapidly in a niche long dominated by larger but less nimble financial institutions.The bank 's rise has been driven not only by the pace and complexity of modern campaigns , which demand increasingly specialized financial services , but by their vastly expanded scale : Billion-dollar presidential campaigns are expected for both parties in 2016 , bolstered by super PACs raising hundreds of millions of dollars more.And with Republican outside groups raising substantially more than their left-leaning counterparts this year , Democratic strategists viewed Amalgamated as a tool to leverage the financial clout of labor unions and left-leaning philanthropists.Founded and still principally owned by labor unions , the 92-year-old bank has signed up hundreds of new political clients , including most of the Democratic Party 's major committees , the progressive organizations that align with them , and several of their top Senate recruits.This spring , Amalgamated scored its biggest coup yet , winning the main business for Mrs. Clinton 's presidential campaign , which is likely to raise a billion dollars or more.Campaign clients have access to a 24-hour concierge service , staffed by veterans of President Obama 's campaigns , to handle last-minute media buys or reconcile election paperwork.Because it knows their donor world , Amalgamated is willing to advance cash on new contributions , almost immediately .

At the same time , if two Republican governors , Scott Walker in Wisconsin and Rick Snyder in Michigan , win re-election , these two Midwestern states will shift in 2016 from the reliably Democratic column to competitive status.Details down to precinct level results in all the competitive races this year will be studied closely by party officials and political scientists to determine whether Republicans have caught up with Democrats in the world of big-data , high-tech voter mobilization.In the last two presidential elections , the Obama campaign and Democratic interest groups remained far ahead of Republicans in the so-called ground war techniques of locating favorable voters wherever they can be found , registering citizens likely to be supportive , and making sure every supporter casts a ballot , in person , by mail , or through early voting processes.In the current contest , however , both the Republican National Committee and the network of conservative groups allied with the Koch brothers have invested millions in microtargeting innovation , and are attempting to level the playing field.Estimates of the effectiveness of microtargeting vary , but , if the 2016 election is close , new digital strategies developed in recent years to marshal favorable voters will be crucial to the outcome.As the election campaign comes to a close , polls suggest that Republican candidates vulnerable to ` war on women ' accusations have learned how to successfully revamp.Senate candidates in Virginia , North Carolina and Colorado have adopted the strategy of signaling support for women 's reproductive rights by pointedly endorsing access to over-the-counter ` morning after ' contraceptive pills.Representative Cory Gardner , the Republican challenging Senator Mark Udall of Colorado , has not only called for the availability of the day-after pill , he has repudiated his past support for a ` personhood ' constitutional amendment that would effectively ban all abortions .

When Ready for Hillary , a pro-Hillary Rodham Clinton ` super PAC , ' wanted to take out a million-dollar loan five months before it planned to go out of business , it turned to a bank that was founded to guard the savings of New York City garment workers.When the Democracy Alliance , an influential club of liberal donors , sought to recruit members in advance of the 2016 elections , the bank 's president helped to make introductions.And when workers-rights groups wanted to embarrass Walmart and the Gap for unsafe working conditions at factories supplying their stores , Amalgamated Bank , which manages $ 40 billion in pension fund assets , stepped in again , rounding up fellow investors to warn the companies that they could face lawsuits and shareholder actions.Four years after nearly collapsing amid the financial crisis , Amalgamated has aggressively carved out a position as the left 's private banker , leveraging deep connections with the Democratic establishment to expand rapidly in a niche long dominated by larger but less nimble financial institutions.The bank 's rise has been driven not only by the pace and complexity of modern campaigns , which demand increasingly specialized financial services , but by their vastly expanded scale : Billion-dollar presidential campaigns are expected for both parties in 2016 , bolstered by super PACs raising hundreds of millions of dollars more.And with Republican outside groups raising substantially more than their left-leaning counterparts this year , Democratic strategists viewed Amalgamated as a tool to leverage the financial clout of labor unions and left-leaning philanthropists.Founded and still principally owned by labor unions , the 92-year-old bank has signed up hundreds of new political clients , including most of the Democratic Party 's major committees , the progressive organizations that align with them , and several of their top Senate recruits.This spring , Amalgamated scored its biggest coup yet , winning the main business for Mrs. Clinton 's presidential campaign , which is likely to raise a billion dollars or more.Campaign clients have access to a 24-hour concierge service , staffed by veterans of President Obama 's campaigns , to handle last-minute media buys or reconcile election paperwork.Because it knows their donor world , Amalgamated is willing to advance cash on new contributions , almost immediately .

A fast-talking and born-again veteran of conservative politics with experience in Washington , Texas and California , Mr. Lane , 60 , travels the country trying to persuade evangelical clergy members to become politically active.His hope is that the politicized pastors will help mobilize congregations that have been disheartened by the repeated failure of socially conservative candidates , and by a party that has softened its opposition to same-sex marriage.It is an organizing approach far different from those in the days when larger-than-life leaders like the Moral Majority founder , Jerry Falwell , who died in 2007 , or Pat Robertson , now 84 , could activate evangelical voters simply by anointing a candidate.But close observers of evangelicals and their political involvement say Mr. Lane is emblematic of a new generation of evangelical leaders who draw local support or exert influence through niche issues or their own networks.Unlike political operatives such as Ralph Reed , the former executive director of the Christian Coalition who helped elect George W. Bush before becoming ensnared in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal , Mr. Lane does not have an extensive organization.What Mr. Lane , a former public relations man , does have going for him is a decentralized landscape in which a determined believer with an extensive network of ground-level evangelical leaders and a limitless capacity for talking on the phone can exert influence on Republican presidential candidates eager to reach evangelical voters .

To win the presidency , Republicans clearly need to improve their numbers among women , but their approach on reproductive issues appears likely to make that goal difficult.Further compounding the hurdles facing Republicans are the party 's current drive to defund Planned Parenthood , and the sustained effort to reduce the number of abortion clinics in Republican-controlled states.This effort includes legislation effectively closing such clinics by requiring , in the case of Texas , that ' a physician performing or inducing an abortion must , on the date the abortion is performed , have active admitting privileges at a hospital that is located not further than 30 miles from the location at which the abortion is performed , ' and that abortion facilities must meet the ` minimum standards for ambulatory surgical centers ' ; requiring women to undergo sometimes invasive ultrasound procedures before being allowed to have an abortion ; and imposing restrictions on abortion coverage in private health insurance plans.The conflicts over reproductive rights within both the Republican Party and within the social conservative movement are inevitable .

`` A Democrat familiar with Biden 's deliberations said recent discussions have focused on whether Biden 's family would be ready to pursue a third presidential campaign only months after the death of the vice president 's son , Beau Biden.Also under consideration is whether Biden can meet the basic criteria to be a serious contender , such as whether he would have a plausible path to victory in the campaign and whether he would be able to raise enough money to be competitive.The Democrat spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the private conversations.Biden 's trip to Florida , one of the nation 's premiere campaign battleground states , includes meetings with Jewish leaders on Thursday who are skeptical of Obama 's effort to win support for the nuclear deal with Iran.He then heads to Pittsburgh to march in a Labor Day parade on Monday with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka , who met privately with the vice president last week and says `` the field is still wide open '' if Biden decides to run.The travels mark the latest chapter in Biden 's deliberations , which have included private discussions with family members and longtime aides at his Delaware home and a Naval Observatory meeting with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , a popular liberal whose endorsement would be coveted by any Democratic candidate.Warren said Wednesday that she and Biden had `` a good long rambly policy conversation '' at the Naval Observatory .

`` A Democrat familiar with Biden 's deliberations said recent discussions have focused on whether Biden 's family would be ready to pursue a third presidential campaign only months after the death of the vice president 's son , Beau Biden.Also under consideration is whether Biden can meet the basic criteria to be a serious contender , such as whether he would have a plausible path to victory in the campaign and whether he would be able to raise enough money to be competitive.The Democrat spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the private conversations.Biden 's trip to Florida , one of the nation 's premiere campaign battleground states , includes meetings with Jewish leaders on Thursday who are skeptical of Obama 's effort to win support for the nuclear deal with Iran.He then heads to Pittsburgh to march in a Labor Day parade on Monday with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka , who met privately with the vice president last week and says `` the field is still wide open '' if Biden decides to run.The travels mark the latest chapter in Biden 's deliberations , which have included private discussions with family members and longtime aides at his Delaware home and a Naval Observatory meeting with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , a popular liberal whose endorsement would be coveted by any Democratic candidate.Warren said Wednesday that she and Biden had `` a good long rambly policy conversation '' at the Naval Observatory .

Patriot Act , known as Section 215 , which permits the F.B.I. to obtain business records deemed ` relevant ' to a national security investigation.The theory , accepted by the intelligence court but rejected in a recent appeals court ruling , is that everyone 's records are relevant to investigations hunting for terrorists because analyzing indirect links between callers can , in theory , reveal hidden relationships and sleeper cells.After praising the program as crucial to preventing terrorist attacks , intelligence agency officials now say that it has never thwarted one .

Elizabeth Warren , a popular liberal whose endorsement would be coveted by any Democratic candidate.Warren said Wednesday that she and Biden had `` a good long rambly policy conversation '' at the Naval Observatory .

A fast-talking and born-again veteran of conservative politics with experience in Washington , Texas and California , Mr. Lane , 60 , travels the country trying to persuade evangelical clergy members to become politically active.His hope is that the politicized pastors will help mobilize congregations that have been disheartened by the repeated failure of socially conservative candidates , and by a party that has softened its opposition to same-sex marriage.It is an organizing approach far different from those in the days when larger-than-life leaders like the Moral Majority founder , Jerry Falwell , who died in 2007 , or Pat Robertson , now 84 , could activate evangelical voters simply by anointing a candidate.But close observers of evangelicals and their political involvement say Mr. Lane is emblematic of a new generation of evangelical leaders who draw local support or exert influence through niche issues or their own networks.Unlike political operatives such as Ralph Reed , the former executive director of the Christian Coalition who helped elect George W. Bush before becoming ensnared in the Jack Abramoff lobbying scandal , Mr. Lane does not have an extensive organization.What Mr. Lane , a former public relations man , does have going for him is a decentralized landscape in which a determined believer with an extensive network of ground-level evangelical leaders and a limitless capacity for talking on the phone can exert influence on Republican presidential candidates eager to reach evangelical voters .

Confusion among European leaders about how to deal with the crisis raises questions about the political unity that is essential to the survival of the eurozone.These factors could undermine the positive effects of the bond-buying stimulus program , known as quantitative easing , that the European Central Bank began in March as a way to pump money into the eurozone economy and force down market interest rates.As a result , some analysts , so far apparently a minority , expect Mr. Draghi to send a strong signal on Thursday that the central bank 's Governing Council is ready to step up its bond purchases and continue them longer than currently planned.But any talk of more stimulus would reawaken tensions on the Governing Council between those who think the central bank has already done too much and those who favor aggressive , pre-emptive action .

To win the presidency , Republicans clearly need to improve their numbers among women , but their approach on reproductive issues appears likely to make that goal difficult.Further compounding the hurdles facing Republicans are the party 's current drive to defund Planned Parenthood , and the sustained effort to reduce the number of abortion clinics in Republican-controlled states.This effort includes legislation effectively closing such clinics by requiring , in the case of Texas , that ' a physician performing or inducing an abortion must , on the date the abortion is performed , have active admitting privileges at a hospital that is located not further than 30 miles from the location at which the abortion is performed , ' and that abortion facilities must meet the ` minimum standards for ambulatory surgical centers ' ; requiring women to undergo sometimes invasive ultrasound procedures before being allowed to have an abortion ; and imposing restrictions on abortion coverage in private health insurance plans.The conflicts over reproductive rights within both the Republican Party and within the social conservative movement are inevitable .

`` A Democrat familiar with Biden 's deliberations said recent discussions have focused on whether Biden 's family would be ready to pursue a third presidential campaign only months after the death of the vice president 's son , Beau Biden.Also under consideration is whether Biden can meet the basic criteria to be a serious contender , such as whether he would have a plausible path to victory in the campaign and whether he would be able to raise enough money to be competitive.The Democrat spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the private conversations.Biden 's trip to Florida , one of the nation 's premiere campaign battleground states , includes meetings with Jewish leaders on Thursday who are skeptical of Obama 's effort to win support for the nuclear deal with Iran.He then heads to Pittsburgh to march in a Labor Day parade on Monday with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka , who met privately with the vice president last week and says `` the field is still wide open '' if Biden decides to run.The travels mark the latest chapter in Biden 's deliberations , which have included private discussions with family members and longtime aides at his Delaware home and a Naval Observatory meeting with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , a popular liberal whose endorsement would be coveted by any Democratic candidate.Warren said Wednesday that she and Biden had `` a good long rambly policy conversation '' at the Naval Observatory .

When Ready for Hillary , a pro-Hillary Rodham Clinton ` super PAC , ' wanted to take out a million-dollar loan five months before it planned to go out of business , it turned to a bank that was founded to guard the savings of New York City garment workers.When the Democracy Alliance , an influential club of liberal donors , sought to recruit members in advance of the 2016 elections , the bank 's president helped to make introductions.And when workers-rights groups wanted to embarrass Walmart and the Gap for unsafe working conditions at factories supplying their stores , Amalgamated Bank , which manages $ 40 billion in pension fund assets , stepped in again , rounding up fellow investors to warn the companies that they could face lawsuits and shareholder actions.Four years after nearly collapsing amid the financial crisis , Amalgamated has aggressively carved out a position as the left 's private banker , leveraging deep connections with the Democratic establishment to expand rapidly in a niche long dominated by larger but less nimble financial institutions.The bank 's rise has been driven not only by the pace and complexity of modern campaigns , which demand increasingly specialized financial services , but by their vastly expanded scale : Billion-dollar presidential campaigns are expected for both parties in 2016 , bolstered by super PACs raising hundreds of millions of dollars more.And with Republican outside groups raising substantially more than their left-leaning counterparts this year , Democratic strategists viewed Amalgamated as a tool to leverage the financial clout of labor unions and left-leaning philanthropists.Founded and still principally owned by labor unions , the 92-year-old bank has signed up hundreds of new political clients , including most of the Democratic Party 's major committees , the progressive organizations that align with them , and several of their top Senate recruits.This spring , Amalgamated scored its biggest coup yet , winning the main business for Mrs. Clinton 's presidential campaign , which is likely to raise a billion dollars or more.Campaign clients have access to a 24-hour concierge service , staffed by veterans of President Obama 's campaigns , to handle last-minute media buys or reconcile election paperwork.Because it knows their donor world , Amalgamated is willing to advance cash on new contributions , almost immediately .

At the same time , if two Republican governors , Scott Walker in Wisconsin and Rick Snyder in Michigan , win re-election , these two Midwestern states will shift in 2016 from the reliably Democratic column to competitive status.Details down to precinct level results in all the competitive races this year will be studied closely by party officials and political scientists to determine whether Republicans have caught up with Democrats in the world of big-data , high-tech voter mobilization.In the last two presidential elections , the Obama campaign and Democratic interest groups remained far ahead of Republicans in the so-called ground war techniques of locating favorable voters wherever they can be found , registering citizens likely to be supportive , and making sure every supporter casts a ballot , in person , by mail , or through early voting processes.In the current contest , however , both the Republican National Committee and the network of conservative groups allied with the Koch brothers have invested millions in microtargeting innovation , and are attempting to level the playing field.Estimates of the effectiveness of microtargeting vary , but , if the 2016 election is close , new digital strategies developed in recent years to marshal favorable voters will be crucial to the outcome.As the election campaign comes to a close , polls suggest that Republican candidates vulnerable to ` war on women ' accusations have learned how to successfully revamp.Senate candidates in Virginia , North Carolina and Colorado have adopted the strategy of signaling support for women 's reproductive rights by pointedly endorsing access to over-the-counter ` morning after ' contraceptive pills.Representative Cory Gardner , the Republican challenging Senator Mark Udall of Colorado , has not only called for the availability of the day-after pill , he has repudiated his past support for a ` personhood ' constitutional amendment that would effectively ban all abortions .

`` A Democrat familiar with Biden 's deliberations said recent discussions have focused on whether Biden 's family would be ready to pursue a third presidential campaign only months after the death of the vice president 's son , Beau Biden.Also under consideration is whether Biden can meet the basic criteria to be a serious contender , such as whether he would have a plausible path to victory in the campaign and whether he would be able to raise enough money to be competitive.The Democrat spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the private conversations.Biden 's trip to Florida , one of the nation 's premiere campaign battleground states , includes meetings with Jewish leaders on Thursday who are skeptical of Obama 's effort to win support for the nuclear deal with Iran.He then heads to Pittsburgh to march in a Labor Day parade on Monday with AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka , who met privately with the vice president last week and says `` the field is still wide open '' if Biden decides to run.The travels mark the latest chapter in Biden 's deliberations , which have included private discussions with family members and longtime aides at his Delaware home and a Naval Observatory meeting with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , a popular liberal whose endorsement would be coveted by any Democratic candidate.Warren said Wednesday that she and Biden had `` a good long rambly policy conversation '' at the Naval Observatory .

Mikulski 's decision came a day after Mr. Coons and Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and several Democrats in the House also announced they would support the deal.With momentum on their side , the White House and Senate Democrats next week hope to find seven more votes to filibuster the Republican resolution of disapproval , something that enrages Republicans , who made ample use of the filibuster when in the minority.Senators Mark S. Kirk , Republican of Illinois , and Robert Menendez , Democrat of New Jersey , both opponents of the current Iran accord , introduced legislation this year that would extend the Iran Sanctions Act , which expires at the end of 2016 , for another decade.While most lawmakers understand the need to have legal authority to ` snap back ' any sanctions that are lifted , Republicans would most likely move to enforce those sanctions , putting Democrats in a bind in an election year by pushing for a vote on legislation to punish Iran for killing Americans and Israelis , and for supporting Hezbollah , leaving the president little choice but to veto because if he signed it , the Iranians would say they are no longer bound by broader agreement.Even if these sanctions are never reimposed , Republicans could use the issue in an effort to divide Democrats in 2016 .
